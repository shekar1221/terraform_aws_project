Quick decision table
Situation	Best Action
Prevent deletion	prevent_destroy = true
AWS-level protection	deletion_protection = true
State deleted	terraform import
AWS deleted	terraform apply
Wrong destroy	Restore state from S3
Stop managing	terraform state rm


🧠 If you ever WANT to delete (intentionally)

Remove:

lifecycle {
  prevent_destroy = true
}


Run:

terraform apply
terraform destroy


Safe by default. Dangerous only on purpose 

Resource deleted — how to find & restore 😬
🔍 Case 1: Resource deleted in AWS but still in state

Terraform will fail like:

Error: instance not found

Fix → Recreate
terraform apply


Terraform will create it again.

🔍 Case 2: Resource exists in AWS but deleted from state

Solution → Import
terraform import aws_instance.web i-0abc12345


Then:

terraform plan
terraform apply

🔍 Case 3: Resource destroyed by Terraform apply
Options:
🔁 1. Rollback using versioned state (BEST)
If using S3 backend with versioning:

aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket tf-state-prod


Restore previous state version in S3 console ✔️

Then:

terraform plan
terraform apply
2. Recreate manually

If state + resource both gone:

terraform apply


⚠️ Data loss possible (EBS, RDS without snapshots)
Extra PRO tips (real-world)
🧠 Use terraform state rm instead of destroy

If you want Terraform to stop managing but not delete:

terraform state rm aws_instance.web


Resource stays alive in AWS.

Enable snapshots

For things that matter:

RDS → automated backups

EBS → snapshots

S3 → versioning

Terraform cannot restore data — AWS backups can.
